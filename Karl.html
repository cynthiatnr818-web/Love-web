        <div class="letter-content">
            <p>Dear Mr. Karl,</p>
            
            <div class="bilingual-paragraph">
                <p>You are the best teacher I have ever met. I've said this many times, and every time I mean it from the bottom of my heart. You're not the kind of teacher who just sticks to textbooks. What you've taught me goes far beyond the scope of physics.</p>
                <p>Thank you for firmly telling me when I doubted whether I was suitable for math: "Your rigor and curiosity make you a born physicist." Thank you for seriously telling me it was dangerous when I tried to manipulate others' emotions. Thank you for stopping me with a smile without embarrassing me when I spoke carelessly.</p>
                <p>Thank you for showing me that a good teacher can be both a strict mentor and a friend. When the Oxford rejection letter came, you said you'd prepare tissues if I cried. But you know what? The strength you taught me didn't let me cry for long.</p>
                <p>You changed my way of thinking, broadened my horizons, and more importantly—you showed me what an educator should be like. I will always remember what you said: "BNDS is a school, not an application factory." I will carry everything you taught me and continue moving forward.</p>
